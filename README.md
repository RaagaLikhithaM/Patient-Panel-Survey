This R script analyzes patient engagement data, focusing on PHQ-9 scores (a measure of depression severity) across different types of patient contact. The analysis includes statistical tests, visualizations, and a predictive model to understand the relationship between contact methods and patient outcomes.

**Data Loading and Preprocessing**

The script begins by loading the necessary libraries and importing the dataset. It then cleans and formats the data for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

This section includes summary statistics and initial visualizations to understand the distribution of PHQ-9 scores and their relationship with other variables.

**Statistical Analysis**
The script performs an ANOVA test to determine if there are significant differences in PHQ-9 scores across contact types, followed by post-hoc Tukey HSD tests for pairwise comparisons.

**Visualization**
Various plots are generated to illustrate the relationships between PHQ-9 scores, contact types, and other relevant variables.

**Patient Prioritization**
A scoring system is implemented to prioritize patients for outreach based on their PHQ-9 scores, PAM scores, medication adherence, and physical activity levels.

**Predictive Modeling**
A linear regression model is developed to predict PHQ-9 scores based on contact type, medication adherence, and average daily steps.

**Key Findings**
Digital contacts are associated with higher PHQ-9 scores, indicating potentially more severe depression symptoms.
Group, in-person clinic, and phone contacts show lower average PHQ-9 scores.
There is significant variability in PHQ-9 scores across different types of contact for individual patients.
The ANOVA test reveals statistically significant differences in PHQ-9 scores across contact types.
The predictive model shows that contact type and physical activity are significant predictors of PHQ-9 scores.

**Requirements**
R (version 4.0.0 or higher)
Required R packages: readxl, dplyr, ggplot2, writexl, stats, multcomp, caret


**Recommendations**

-Consider personalizing contact methods based on individual patient responses.

-Investigate why digital contacts are associated with higher PHQ-9 scores.

-Expand digital engagement for patients with more severe symptoms, while maintaining a mix of contact methods.

-Implement targeted interventions for patients identified as high priority by the scoring system.

-Utilize the predictive model to identify patients at risk of higher PHQ-9 scores and intervene proactively.

**Future Directions**

-Incorporate additional data points such as social determinants of health and more detailed clinical history.

-Explore the use of wearable devices and mobile health applications for real-time data collection.

-Implement more advanced machine learning models for risk prediction and personalized care strategies.

-Conduct longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impact of different contact methods on patient outcomes.

**Notes**

-This analysis is based on a specific dataset and may not generalize to all patient populations.

-Ensure patient privacy and data security when implementing any recommendations.

-Regularly evaluate and adapt the engagement strategies based on ongoing analysis results.
